## [Unreleased]

Wave 1 trustworthy-measurement + train-once transforms (BL-013, BL-015, BL-017,
BL-020, BL-025) plus the LLM metric rename below. Behaviour-changing; intended
next release is a **minor** (0.12.0), not a patch. No version bump in this commit.

### Added

- **`KamiranCaldersReweighing`** ([JobCollins#44](https://github.com/JobCollins/fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit/issues/44)):
  label-aware reweighing `w(s,y)=(n_s·n_y)/(n·n_sy)` with joint sensitive cells,
  optional `max_weight` clip+renorm, train-only `sample_weight_` /
  `cell_weights_`, and `KamiranCaldersLabelError` when labels are missing.
  Wired into the transformer registry and `PipelineResult.sample_weight`.
- **`apply_pipeline(..., y=None)`** forwards labels to `pipe.fit_transform(X, y)`;
  `execute_workflow` passes `y_train` when fitting. CLI/REST still supply labels
  via the step `label` parameter (defaulted from `training.target_column`).

### Deprecated

- **`ReweighingTransformer`**: emits `FutureWarning`; prefer
  `InstanceReweighting` (frequency balancing) or `KamiranCaldersReweighing`
  (label-aware). Not turned into an alias — implementation differences would
  change existing weights.

### Documentation

- **`DOCS.md` / `docs/api.md`**: document `KamiranCaldersReweighing` (formula,
  citation, guarantees / non-guarantees); correct the false `strategy`
  parameter on `ReweighingTransformer`; clarify which class to use and that
  only `reductions` consumes weights today ([#58](https://github.com/JobCollins/fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit/issues/58)).

### Upgrade notes (breaking)

Read this before upgrading from ≤0.11.0.

- **LLM metric rename (`counterfactual_fairness_*` → `demographic_swap_*`).**
  `demographic_swap_divergence` / `demographic_swap_contrast` replace
  `counterfactual_fairness_divergence` / `counterfactual_fairness_contrast`.
  The old names remain **input** aliases for one release (YAML `evaluators:`,
  REST bodies, CLI `--metric`, protocol method names, class import) and emit
  `FutureWarning` (visible under default filters; CLI also prints to stderr;
  REST returns a `deprecations` list). **Outputs use only the new keys** —
  `result.metrics["counterfactual_fairness_divergence"]` raises `KeyError`
  (deliberate; do not emit both). Case study moved to
  `case_studies/llm_fairness_measurement_pitfalls.ipynb`; a stub remains at the
  old path so PyPI / GitHub absolute links do not 404 until the next release
  updates them.
- **Undersized groups / non-finite LLM metrics** no longer pass the gate silently.
  They produce `gate_status: "undefined"`, CLI exit **4**, and
  `assert_llm_fairness` raises (unless `allow_nan=True` on the plugin). Precedence:
  illustrative > undefined > fail > pass.
- **Probability scores as `y_pred` raise.** Passing `predict_proba(X)[:, 1]` (or any
  non-{0,1} encoding with more than two distinct values) raises
  `MulticlassNotSupportedError` / `NonBinaryEncodingError`. Threshold first, e.g.
  `(proba >= 0.5).astype(int)`. The error message says so.
- **Multiclass and non-`{0,1}` binary encodings raise** (`MulticlassNotSupportedError`,
  `NonBinaryEncodingError`). Positive class is **1**.
- **NaN/inf in `y_true` / `y_pred`** are dropped; the result reports
  `n_dropped_nonfinite` and a caveat (same idea as protected-attribute
  `nan_policy="exclude"`).
- **Mismatched pandas indices** among `y_true` / `y_pred` / `sensitive` /
  `attrs_df` raise `IndexMismatchError` instead of silently zipping by position.
  Fix with `.reindex()` / `.loc` / `.reset_index(drop=True)`. Mixed Series+array
  stays positional.
- **Transforms fit on training data only.** `execute_workflow` /
  `apply_pipeline(..., fit=False)` apply the train-fitted mapping to test.
  `DisparateImpactRemover` uses fitted train group CDFs, so single-row and batch
  transforms agree. Workflows that refit on test or relied on within-batch ranks
  get **different numbers**.
- **LLM / pytest gates use magnitude.** `assert_llm_fairness` matches CLI/REST:
  caveated results fail as illustrative; non-caveated use `abs(value) > threshold`.
  A large **negative** signed contrast therefore fails — documented, not changed.
  `comparator` is unused (call-site compatibility only).

### Fixed

- **Detectors mis-routed pandas `StringDtype` columns into ANOVA (pandas 3 / explicit
  string).** `StatisticalDisparityDetector` and `ProxyVariableDetector` now treat
  `is_string_dtype` as categorical (shared `_is_categorical_series` helper), so
  string features use chi-squared / Cramér's V instead of crashing in `f_oneway`.
- **ProxyDropper association scoring on string / constant columns.** Replaced
  fragile ``str(dtype).startswith(...)`` checks with pandas dtype APIs
  (``is_string_dtype`` / categorical / object) and hardened absolute Pearson
  via ``np.corrcoef`` with zero-variance / NaN guards. Min paired sample
  count remains **3** (unchanged numeric contract).
- **Analyzer bootstrap stats were non-deterministic (Wave 1a / BL-013).** Classifier
  CI stats ignored the bootstrap resample and redrew via global `np.random`,
  invalidating BCa and distorting percentile intervals. Index-based stats now drive
  DPD/EOD/MAE CIs.
- **BCa percentile units were wrong in every release from v0.2.0 through v0.11.0
  (Wave 1b / BL-013).** Accel/bias-corrected probabilities were passed to
  `np.percentile` unscaled (fraction vs percent). BCa is **opt-in**; the **default
  percentile CI path was unaffected** — published figures that used the default are
  not automatically suspect. Only callers who set BCa need to recompute.

### Performance

- **Analyzer bootstrap CI is now vectorised per group count.** `demographic_parity_difference`,
  `equalized_odds_difference`, and `mae_parity_difference` computed each bootstrap
  replicate's group means with a Python loop over groups, each doing an
  `O(n)` boolean comparison — `O(n_groups * n)` per replicate. Group membership is
  now encoded once per call into an integer array and each replicate uses a single
  `np.bincount` pass, `O(n)` regardless of group count. Intersectional calls (more
  groups) see the largest wins (~3-7x on the 100k-row benchmark); outputs are
  unchanged (binary-metric values are bit-exact, MAE differs only at the ~1e-15
  floating-point-summation-order level, well inside the project's `1e-12` tolerance).

### Changed (detail)

- Shared `metrics/input_validation.py` for analyzer + adapters (BL-015);
  `LengthMismatchError` replaces raw NumPy `IndexError` on length mismatch.
- `apply_pipeline(..., fit=True|False)`; reweighing steps keep train-sized
  `sample_weight_` without refitting on transform (BL-025). Persistence remains
  pickle/joblib of the sklearn `Pipeline` — no first-class fairpipe serialize API.
  REST `/pipeline` still fit-transforms the uploaded frame once.

### Not fixed in this batch (still open)

- **BL-014** — percentile CI coverage at true DPD equality remains ~0/100; the
  determinism fix did not resolve it. Wave 3.
- **BL-031** — BCa has no policy for NaN bootstrap replicates from analyzer stats.
- **Signed-metric gate** — `abs(value) > threshold` means a large negative contrast
  fails; intentional alignment with CLI, not changed here.
- **Deploy follow-ons** — REST `/pipeline` cannot apply a previously fitted
  pipeline; no first-class transform serialization beyond pickle/joblib.

## [v0.11.0] — 2026-09-21

Additive minor: `demographic_swap_contrast` plus the divergence interpretation
correction that 0.10.0's PyPI README still framed wrongly.

**`demographic_swap_contrast`** reports gated-dimension divergence against a
same-coded control baseline measured in the **same run**, because the raw divergence
metric's no-effect baseline is ~0.19–0.26, not 0. Two controls in the same domain
measured **0.190** and **0.258** (~36% spread), so the baseline must be per-run rather
than a shipped constant.

**Interpretation correction:** divergence figures published at 0.10.0 (hiring **0.196**)
are lexical distance, not evidence of group effects. A CI excluding 0 does **not**
indicate a group effect for that metric.

### Added

- **`demographic_swap_contrast` (BL-012):** sibling metric to
  `demographic_swap_divergence`. Configures an explicit
  `counterfactual.control_dimension` whose values are same-coded (within-group baseline);
  reports signed `max(gated means) − control mean` with an independent difference-of-means
  bootstrap CI. Near-zero or negative is the expected null reading. Does **not** change
  what `demographic_swap_divergence` returns. Costs: roughly doubles API calls;
  control values must be genuinely same-coded or the contrast under-reports (David→Tariq
  trap). Gate is magnitude-based (`abs(value) > threshold`) while the metric is signed.
- **`counterfactual.control_dimension`:** validated in the counterfactual config block
  (must name an existing dimension with ≥2 values; cannot be the sole dimension; required
  when the contrast evaluator is listed).
- **`recorded_humanitarian_contrast/` + `humanitarian_contrast_config()`:** humanitarian
  gated arm (copied from `recorded_refusal/`) plus live-recorded same-coded control arm
  (Fatima / Amina / Leyla × 5 templates, Haiku, `temperature=0`, `max_tokens=512`). Manifest
  omits `illustrative`. Recorded contrast ≈ **−0.056** (gated ≈ 0.202, control ≈ 0.258;
  95% CI ≈ −0.128 to 0.004, includes 0) — expected null. Control mean **0.258** is ~36%
  above the earlier one-template within-group control (**0.190**), which is why the baseline
  is per-run rather than a shipped constant. Two control prompts share byte-identical
  gender-arm cache entries; the difference-of-means CI still treats the arms as independent.
  BL-012 remains open pending backlog confirmation.
- **`counterfactual.name_pools`:** optional `{dimension: {group_label: [value_per_template, ...]}}`
  on `CounterfactualConfig`. When set, `generate_counterfactual_prompts()` substitutes the
  pooled value into the template while `CounterfactualPrompt.group` stays the semantic label.
  YAML/REST validation rejects wrong-length pools, unknown dimensions, and unknown group
  labels. Absent or empty `name_pools` is a no-op (Phase 1 hiring fixtures unchanged).
  `provider: local` is not supported for name-pool probes (`biased_hiring_responder` keys
  off literal `"woman"` / `"man"` substrings). Rotate names across templates: a
  single-name-per-group design can report a gender-looking disparity that is an artifact
  of one name string (humanitarian recording: David 0.0 vs Tariq 1.0 on identical
  asylum-template text).
- **`humanitarian_divergence_config()`:** replays the humanitarian
  `recorded_refusal/` cache under `demographic_swap_divergence` (same
  templates, `name_pools`, params, and `cache_dir` as
  `default_recorded_refusal_config()`). Finite at n=5/group, `caveat` is `None`.
  The 0.202 figure is lexical distance, not a group effect — see the
  interpretation correction below and [BL-012](docs/fairpipe-technical-backlog.md#bl-012--demographic_swap_divergence-has-no-no-effect-baseline).
- **`recorded_within_group_control/`:** nine live Haiku responses (one asylum
  template × three same-coded names per group) that establish the no-effect
  baseline for `demographic_swap_divergence` at ~0.19. Manifest omits
  `illustrative`. This is evidence for BL-012, not a group-effect measurement.
- **BL-011:** `refusal_score` / `refusal_rate_disparity` detect phrase-level refusal
  signals and do not distinguish a genuine refusal to engage from a scope disclaimer on
  an otherwise complete answer. Documented limitation; scorer unchanged.

### Documentation

- **BL-010 closed:** `llm-fairness-check` mode landed in
  [`SvrusIO/fairpipe-action@v2`](https://github.com/SvrusIO/fairpipe-action)
  (merge `b629800`). README, `docs/integration_guide.md`, and case-study snippets
  use `@v2`. `demographic_swap_divergence` now calls `with_fixture_caveat`
  (same path as refusal / toxicity / stereotype).
- `docs/fairpipe-technical-backlog.md`: BL-010 marked closed with acceptance
  criteria checked off.
- **Case study rewrite:** `case_studies/llm_fairness_measurement_pitfalls.ipynb` reframed
  around two measurement failures (single-name-per-group artifact; divergence baseline
  ≠ 0) rather than presenting hiring 0.196 as a group-effect finding.

### Changed

- **Recorded humanitarian refusal fixture:** `fixtures/recorded_refusal/` is live Haiku
  data (5 templates × 3 groups, `name_pools`, `max_tokens=512`), not a hiring-cache copy.
  Manifest omits `illustrative`; `caveat_for_cache_dir()` returns `None`. BL-009's
  **refusal-fixture half is closed**; the **disparity-signal half stays open** because
  every response scores 1.0 under lexical `refusal_score` (ceiling; [BL-011](docs/fairpipe-technical-backlog.md#bl-011--refusal_score-cannot-distinguish-refusal-to-engage-from-a-scope-disclaimer)).
  Do **not** cite this fixture as evidence of group-level refusal disparity. Toxicity and BBQ remain illustrative.
- **`populate_recorded_refusal_cache()`** live-records those humanitarian templates
  (Phase 1 cache-once-replay). It no longer copies `recorded_counterfactual_expanded/`.
- **`DemographicSwapEvaluator`** now wraps both the guard/`nan` path and the computed
  result in `with_fixture_caveat()`, matching refusal and toxicity. The expanded Phase 1
  fixture has no `illustrative` manifest key, so the published divergence stays
  `caveat is None`.
- **Fail-closed control fill:** when `control_dimension` is set and a template has two or
  more non-control placeholders, `generate_counterfactual_prompts()` raises
  `ConfigValidationError` instead of silently filling one slot (avoids “Fatima in Fatima”
  collapses). Prefer an explicit `{control}` placeholder.
- **`demographic_swap_divergence` interpretation (v0.10.0 correction):**
  the hiring (≈0.196, 95% CI 0.185–0.205) and humanitarian (≈0.202, 95% CI
  0.188–0.220) figures measure lexical divergence, dominated by token overlap.
  They are **not** evidence of a group effect. A within-group control puts the
  no-effect baseline at ~0.19, not 0; against that baseline both results are
  ~0. A CI excluding 0 does not indicate a group effect for this metric,
  because 0 is not the no-effect baseline. The statistic and bootstrap were
  never wrong; the reference point was. Fixtures, evaluator, and
  `pairwise_divergence` are unchanged. See
  [BL-012](docs/fairpipe-technical-backlog.md#bl-012--demographic_swap_divergence-has-no-no-effect-baseline).

## [v0.10.0] — 2026-08-31

LLM fairness evals (Option A): counterfactual, refusal, toxicity, and BBQ stereotype
metrics, plus REST, CI/CD gating, and production-log sampling into the existing
monitor. Additive minor bump — no breaking changes.

### Added

- **`fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.llm_evals` module (Phase 0 scaffolding):** `LLMEvalAdapter`
  protocol (sibling to `MetricAdapter`), `LLMClient` provider abstraction (OpenAI-compatible,
  Anthropic, local), `ResponseCache`, and `load_llm_eval_config()` for the `llm_eval:` YAML block.
  Shim re-exports at `fairpipe.llm_evals`.
- **`fairpipe[llm]` optional extra:** `openai`, `anthropic`, and `httpx` for LLM provider calls.
- **`live_llm` / `live_bbq` pytest markers:** excluded from default runs
  (`-m 'not live_llm and not live_bbq'`). `live_llm` is provider calls; `live_bbq` is pinned
  BBQ JSONL fetch.
- **Counterfactual fairness probe (Phase 1):** `DemographicSwapEvaluator`, `run_llm_eval()`,
  `fairpipe llm-eval` CLI with `--dry-run`, `--report-md`, and `--transcripts-out`.
- **Case study:** `case_studies/llm_fairness_measurement_pitfalls.ipynb` — Part A is the n=1
  `min_group_size` guard (`nan`); Part B replays the expanded fixture (~0.196 divergence,
  95% CI ≈ 0.185–0.205 on Haiku hiring templates). Guided markdown interprets those
  numbers (lexical feature distance, not a percentage-unfair rate). The first cell prepends
  the repo root to `sys.path` so Jupyter/Cursor kernels that share Homebrew's 3.12.12
  version string still import the package.
- **Recorded fixtures:** n=1 guard demo at `recorded_counterfactual/`; expanded n=9-per-group
  fixture at `recorded_counterfactual_expanded/` (`expanded_recorded_counterfactual_config()`).
- **Replay-only:** `run_llm_eval()` sets `replay_only=True` whenever `cache_dir` is set;
  a cache miss raises `CacheMissError` instead of calling the provider.
- **Shared guards:** `DEFAULT_LLM_MIN_GROUP_SIZE=5` with classifier-parity exclude + `nan` semantics;
  `allow_small_samples` override for illustrative runs only.
- **Phase 2 evaluators:** `refusal_rate_disparity`, `toxicity_sentiment_disparity`,
  `stereotype_association_score` (BBQ loader; local subset by default).
- **`assert_llm_fairness()`** and **`log_llm_eval_results()`** mirroring classifier gating/logging.
- **BL-009 provenance:** `MetricResult.caveat` when the cache ``manifest.json`` has
  ``illustrative: true`` (not a hardcoded path). Markdown + MLflow tags. Fixture re-record
  still open.
- **REST `POST /llm-eval`:** run LLM fairness evals over HTTP (`fairpipe[api]`). Three-state
  `gate_status` (`pass` / `fail` / `illustrative`) with `passed` true / false / null.
  Provider keys stay env-only (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`); credential fields in
  the JSON/YAML body are 422. Default response is aggregated metrics only (no transcripts).
  Cache miss with `cache_dir` set is 4xx (`CacheMissError`), not a live provider call.
- **Live-call kill-switch:** live OpenAI/Anthropic HTTP is **forbidden by default** at the
  SDK call site (`LiveLLMCallForbidden`). A missing or misconfigured `cache_dir` fails
  immediately in Jupyter, CLI, REST, and pytest — not only when `tests/conftest.py` runs.
  Opt in with `FAIRPIPE_LLM_ALLOW_LIVE=1` (`allow_live_llm_calls()`, populate helpers, and
  `@pytest.mark.live_llm`).
- **`fairpipe llm-eval --threshold` / `--metric`:** same three-state gate as
  `POST /llm-eval` (`evaluate_llm_eval_gate()`). Exit 0 pass / 1 fail / 2 usage /
  3 illustrative. A caveated metric exits 3 even when the number would pass the
  threshold. Dry-run still exits 0 and does not call a provider.
- **Local `llm-fairness-check` harness:** `run_llm_fairness_check()` accepts
  Action-shaped `with:` inputs (`config`, `metric`, `threshold`, `fail-on-violation`)
  and returns the reserved exit codes. Wiring a real mode into
  `SvrusIO/fairpipe-action` is BL-010 (companion repo).
- **Production LLM monitoring sampler:** `sample_production_llm_records()` keeps
  1/N production log rows (`N=1` keeps all) as a group label plus a 0/1 score
  and feeds the existing `RealTimeFairnessTracker` /
  `FairnessDriftAndAlertEngine` (unpaired group-rate disparity, not
  counterfactual matched-pairing). `random_state` is caller-supplied (tests pin
  a value; omit to vary per call via timestamp ⊕ counter). Kept rows stay in
  original relative order. No provider HTTP. Adapter default
  `min_group_size=5`. Transcripts are dropped before ingest.

  `docs/integration_guide.md`: version **0.10.0**. Classifier `ColumnMap` examples
  use `protected=` (the actual field), not `sensitive=`.

### Changed

- Version bumped to **0.10.0** in `pyproject.toml`,
  `fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.__version__`, and `docs/conf.py`.

## [v0.9.1] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **`execute_workflow` training controls** (runtime-only, not in YAML or CLI):
  - `class_weight` (`str | dict | None`, default `"balanced"`) — passed to baseline and
    reductions-path `LogisticRegression` to avoid degenerate majority-class predictions on
    imbalanced data.
  - `decision_threshold` (`float | None`, default `None`) — probability cutoff for binary
    predictions via `predict_proba`; simulates selective classifiers (e.g. hiring screeners).
    When `None`, uses `predict()` (sklearn default 0.5).
- **`StandardScaler` in the integrated workflow**: fitted once on baseline training features
  in `run_baseline_measurement()`; the same scaler is reused with **`transform` only** (never
  refit) in `run_transform_and_train()` so before/after fairness comparisons share identical
  scaling.

### Changed

- **Default `class_weight`**: Workflow baseline and default reductions base estimator now use
  `class_weight="balanced"` instead of sklearn’s implicit `None`.

### Documentation

- `docs/api.md`, `docs/integration_guide.md`, `docs/playbook-part-five-fairpipe.md`, and
  `DOCS.md` document `class_weight`, `decision_threshold`, and scaler behavior.
- Version bumped to **0.9.1** in `pyproject.toml`, `fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.__version__`,
  `docs/conf.py`, and `docs/VERSIONING.md`.

## [v0.9.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added

- **`execute_workflow` `random_state`**: Optional parameter (default `42`) to control the stratified
  train/test split and downstream model RNGs for reproducible end-to-end runs.
- **CLI**: `fairpipe run-pipeline --random-state` (default `42`).
- **REST API**: `random_state` form field on `POST /workflow` (default `42`).

### Changed

- **Integrated workflow split**: `execute_workflow` now builds **one** stratified train/test partition
  (`WorkflowSplit`) shared by baseline measurement, transform-and-train, and final validation,
  instead of three separate `train_test_split` calls. Default `random_state=42` preserves prior
  behavior for existing callers.
- **Training seeds**: Default `LogisticRegression` base estimators for the `reductions` method and
  PyTorch training paths (`regularized`, `lagrangian`) receive `numpy` / `torch` seeds from
  `random_state`.

### Fixed

- **Release workflow**: Removed unsupported `make_latest` input from `softprops/action-gh-release@v1`
  so the “Create GitHub Release” step completes without errors.
- **CLI tests**: `tests/cli/test_run_pipeline.py` mock `Args` objects include `random_state` for
  `cmd_run_pipeline` compatibility.

### Documentation

- `docs/api.md` and `docs/playbook-part-five-fairpipe.md` document `random_state` and reproducibility.
- `docs/conf.py` and `docs/VERSIONING.md` set to **0.9.0**.

## [v0.8.0] — 2026-05-14

### Added

- **Pipeline config `features`**: Optional explicit feature list in YAML / `PipelineConfig`; when
  omitted, `execute_workflow` auto-selects numeric columns (excluding target and sensitive) with a
  logged warning.
- **`fairpipe validate`**: `--threshold` and `--metric` for pass/fail (exit `0` / `1`) and a
  **Threshold verdict** section in the Markdown report; `--metric` is required when `--threshold`
  is set. `--quiet` and non-TTY stdout suppress INFO logs for clean piping.
- **`PipelineResult`**: Structured return from `apply_pipeline` (`data`, `metadata`, `sample_weight`,
  `transformers_applied`).

### Changed

- **`apply_pipeline` return type**: Uses `PipelineResult` instead of a plain tuple. Tuple unpacking
  still works but emits `DeprecationWarning`; prefer attribute access.
- **Logging**: Console handler defaults to **stderr** so stdout stays suitable for reports and pipes
  (`setup_logging(..., console_stream=...)`).

### Fixed

- **`execute_workflow`**: Mixed-type DataFrames no longer break baseline / training feature matrices;
  mitigation **sample weights** from reweighting transformers are applied to training (including
  Fairlearn reductions via an internal mixer); sensitive columns are included in the frame passed to
  the pipeline when needed for `InstanceReweighting`.

### Migration

Replace `Xt, meta = apply_pipeline(pipe, df)` with `result = apply_pipeline(pipe, df)` then
`result.data`, `result.metadata`, and `result.sample_weight` as needed.

---

## [v0.7.4] — 2026-05-12

### Changed

- **README**: Reduced to install, documentation links, minimal quick start, development, and
  project links—detailed CLI, API, configuration, and module content lives in the
  [hosted documentation](https://SvrusIO.github.io/fAIr) and `docs/`.

### Fixed

- **`__version__` sync**: `fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.__version__` and the namespace test now
  match `pyproject.toml` (they had drifted behind earlier releases).

### Documentation

- Example version strings in `DOCS.md`, `docs/api.md`, and `docs/integration_guide.md` updated to
  **0.7.4** where they showed stale values.

---

## [v0.7.3] — 2026-05-12

### Added

- **`fairpipe.stats` shims**: `fairpipe.stats`, `fairpipe.stats.bootstrap`, `fairpipe.stats.bayesian`,
  `fairpipe.stats.effect_size`, and `fairpipe.stats.multipletests` are now importable via the
  `fairpipe.*` compatibility layer, matching the existing shim pattern for other modules.
- **`fairpipe.api` shims**: `fairpipe.api`, `fairpipe.api.app`, `fairpipe.api.store`,
  `fairpipe.api.models`, and `fairpipe.api.routes` are now importable via `fairpipe.*`.
- **`fairpipe.integration.reporting` shim**: `from fairpipe.integration.reporting import
  generate_training_fairness_report` (and other reporting helpers) now resolves correctly.
- **`log_fairness_metrics` export**: Added to `fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.integration.__all__`
  and the `fairpipe.integration` shim; previously existed in `mlflow_logger` but was not exported.

### Fixed

- **`assert_fairness` comparators**: `">="` and `">"` were listed in the docstring but not
  implemented — any comparator other than `"<="` silently applied `<`. All four comparators
  (`<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`) are now correctly dispatched; invalid values raise `ValueError`.
- **Lazy imports in `fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.training`**: All six exports (`ReductionsWrapper`,
  `FairnessRegularizerLoss`, `LagrangianFairnessTrainer`, `GroupFairnessCalibrator`, `sweep_pareto`,
  `plot_pareto`) are now resolved via `__getattr__`, so importing the module no longer fails when
  PyTorch or Fairlearn are not installed.
- **Lazy import of `FairnessReportingDashboard`** in `fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.monitoring`:
  deferred via `__getattr__` so the monitoring module loads cleanly without `fairpipe[monitoring]`.
- **`benjamini_hochberg` docstring**: Clarified that the first return value is adjusted p-values
  in ascending-sorted order, not mapped back to the original input order.

---

## [v0.7.2] — 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **Docs namespace cleanup**: All Python examples across `README.md`, `DOCS.md`, `docs/api.md`,
  and `docs/integration_guide.md` now import from the `fairpipe.*` namespace. The
  `fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.*` namespace continues to work for backward compatibility.

---

## [v0.7.1] — 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **README usage examples**: All Python snippets in the Usage Examples section now import from the
  `fairpipe.*` namespace (e.g. `from fairpipe.metrics import FairnessAnalyzer`) instead of the
  internal `fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.*` namespace.
- **Version assertion in `test_namespace.py`**: Updated hardcoded version string from `0.6.5` →
  `0.7.1` so the test suite passes against the current release.

---

## [v0.7.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added

- **REST API (`fairpipe[api]`)**: Optional FastAPI REST server exposing five HTTP endpoints —
  `GET /health`, `POST /validate`, `POST /pipeline`, `POST /workflow`, and `GET /results/{run_id}`.
  Swagger UI available at `/docs`, ReDoc at `/redoc`.
- **`fairpipe serve` CLI command**: Start the REST API server with `--host`, `--port`, `--reload`,
  and `--workers` options. Lazy-imports `uvicorn` and `fastapi` so the core CLI remains functional
  when the `api` extra is not installed.
- **`ResultStore`**: Thread-safe in-memory LRU result cache (500-entry cap) used by all API routes
  to persist results retrievable via `GET /results/{run_id}`.
- **Dockerfile & `docker-compose.yml`**: Run the REST API in Docker with
  `docker build -t fairpipe-api . && docker run -p 8000:8000 fairpipe-api` or `docker compose up`.
- **13 new API tests** in `tests/api/test_api.py` covering all endpoints, thread safety, error
  handling, and the "passed=false is not 500" contract. Tests auto-skip when the `api` extra is
  absent. Total test count: 738.

### Changed

- CI (`ci.yml`) now installs `.[dev,api]` so all API tests run on every push.

---

## [v0.6.5] — 2026-02-03

### Changed
- Version bump for PyPI production release; no functional changes from v0.6.2.

---

## [v0.6.2] — 2026-02-03

### Changed
- **Step 1 (Baseline Measurement)**: Baseline model training and fairness metrics are now computed inside `run_baseline_measurement()`. The function accepts optional `train_size` and `random_state` and, when `config.training` and `config.fairness_metric` are set, trains an unconstrained LogisticRegression and returns `baseline_metrics` in its result dict. `execute_workflow()` uses this return value and no longer duplicates baseline computation.
- **CLI `run-pipeline` output**: Enhanced workflow results with explicit pass/fail (PASSED/FAILED with symbol), improvement percentage and “(negative = reduction in unfairness)”, a tabular baseline vs final vs change comparison, and short “Baseline (Step 1)” and “Final (Step 3)” summaries.

### Fixed
- **Property-based test**: Resolved Hypothesis `Unsatisfiable` in `test_eo_difference_bounds` by adding an `eo_valid_arrays` strategy that generates aligned `(y_true, y_pred, sensitive)` with at least two groups having both 0 and 1 in `y_true` by construction, so the test no longer relies on strict `assume()` filters.

---

## [v0.6.0] — 2026-01-26

### Changed
- **PyPI Package Name**: Package name changed from `fairness-pipeline-dev-toolkit` to `fairpipe` for a shorter, more user-friendly installation command.
  - **Installation**: Use `pip install fairpipe` instead of `pip install fairness-pipeline-dev-toolkit`
  - **Python Imports**: No changes required - Python imports remain `from fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit import ...`
  - **CLI Command**: No changes - CLI command remains `fairpipe`

### Purpose
This release simplifies the installation experience by providing a shorter package name while maintaining full backward compatibility for Python code. The package name change only affects the `pip install` command; all Python imports and CLI usage remain unchanged.

**Migration Notes**:
- **Breaking Change for Installation**: Users must update their installation commands
  1. Uninstall old package: `pip uninstall fairness-pipeline-dev-toolkit`
  2. Install new package: `pip install fairpipe`
- **No Code Changes Required**: All Python imports remain unchanged:
  - `from fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.metrics import FairnessAnalyzer`
  - `from fairness_pipeline_dev_toolkit.pipeline.config import PipelineConfig`
  - All existing code continues to work without modification
- **CLI Usage**: No changes - continue using `fairpipe` commands as before
- **Optional Extras**: Installation with extras now uses the new name:
  - `pip install fairpipe[training]`
  - `pip install fairpipe[monitoring]`
  - `pip install fairpipe[adapters]`
  - `pip install fairpipe[training,monitoring,adapters]`

---

## [v0.6.1] — 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **Regression Metrics Support**: Added missing `mae_parity_difference` method to `FairlearnAdapter` and `AequitasAdapter`
  - Previously, `mae_parity_difference` was only implemented in `NativeAdapter`, causing failures when users selected `fairlearn` or `aequitas` backends for regression metrics
  - Both adapters now implement the method following the same pattern as `NativeAdapter`
  - Comprehensive test coverage added for both adapters

### Purpose
This patch release fixes a bug where regression metrics (`mae_parity_difference`) would fail when using `fairlearn` or `aequitas` backends. The method was expected by `FairnessAnalyzer` but was missing from these adapters.

**Migration Notes**:
- No breaking changes
- Users can now use `mae_parity_difference` with any backend (native, fairlearn, or aequitas)
- All existing functionality remains unchanged

---

---

## [v0.5.1] — 2025-01-16

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed `IndexError` when using categorical Series with NaN values in intersectional analysis. The `_intersectional_prep()` function now properly handles categorical Series conversion by converting to string first, then to numpy array with proper NaN handling. This resolves issues in `demographic_parity_difference()`, `equalized_odds_difference()`, and `mae_parity_difference()` methods when using intersectional analysis with categorical data.

- **CLI Test Reliability**: Fixed CLI tests to properly handle `SystemExit` exceptions from argparse, improving test reliability.

- **AB Test Assertions**: Updated AB test assertions to account for bootstrap sampling variability, reducing false test failures.

- **Edge Case Handling**: Fixed intersectional tests to handle empty DataFrame edge cases and resolved variable name conflicts in CLI command tests.

### Improved
- **Test Suite Quality**: Comprehensive test suite overhaul with all 645 tests now passing:
  - Tests updated to create sample files within test functions instead of relying on external files (improves isolation and portability)
  - Enhanced assertions in smoke tests to validate actual outputs
  - Added negative test cases for error handling in CLI commands and config loading
  - Improved test organization with better separation of concerns
  - Expanded test coverage from 68% to 87% across all modules

- **Test Documentation**: Enhanced `TEST_REVIEW_REPORT.md` with comprehensive test suite significance analysis, including detailed evaluation of 9 major test suites with star ratings and insights on test suite prioritization.

### Testing
- **Test Coverage**: All 645 tests passing across all modules with 87% code coverage:
  - Core/Measurement: 7 test files
  - Pipeline: 7 test files (including new unit tests for transformers and detectors)
  - Integration: 3 test files
  - System/E2E: 3 test files
  - CLI: 2 test files
  - Training: 5 test files
  - Monitoring: 3 test files (including new AB test coverage)
  - Utils: 2 test files (new coverage for intersectional and validation)
  - Stats: 3 test files (new coverage for effect_size, multipletests, bayesian)
  
- **Coverage Improvements**: Test coverage increased from 68% to 87%, with comprehensive coverage across:
  - Metrics computation and adapters
  - Pipeline transformers and detectors
  - Integration workflows and orchestrator
  - Training methods (reductions, regularized, lagrangian)
  - Monitoring tools and drift detection
  - Statistical validation functions

### Purpose
This patch release addresses a critical bug in intersectional analysis that could cause failures with categorical data, and significantly improves test suite reliability and documentation. The test suite now provides comprehensive coverage with all tests passing, ensuring the toolkit's reliability and correctness.

---

## [v0.5.0] — 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **Integrated End-to-End Workflow**: Introduced unified three-step workflow orchestrator combining Measurement, Pipeline, and Training modules into a single automated process.

- **New CLI Command**: `fairpipe run-pipeline` executes complete workflow:
  1. Baseline Measurement - audit raw data for fairness issues
  2. Transform Data + Train Model - apply bias mitigation and train fairness-aware model
  3. Final Validation - compare metrics to baseline and validate against threshold

- **Extended Config Schema**: Added `training`, `fairness_metric`, and `validation_threshold` fields to support integrated workflow. Config files can now specify training method (reductions, regularized, lagrangian) with method-specific parameters.

- **Complete MLflow Integration**: Enhanced MLflow logger to log complete workflow results including baseline/final metrics, validation status, model artifacts, and config.yml. Enables tracking of fairness experiments over time.

- **Integrated Demo Notebook**: Created `demo_integrated.ipynb` demonstrating the complete integrated workflow from raw data to validated model.

### Changed
- **Config System**: Extended `PipelineConfig` to support training method selection with method-specific parameters. Configs without a `training` section continue to work for pipeline-only execution via `fairpipe pipeline` command.

- **Orchestrator**: Enhanced to handle sensitive attribute encoding for PyTorch models and proper feature matrix construction. Sensitive attributes are now automatically excluded from feature matrices before training.

- **Result Object Handling**: Validation function now correctly handles both Result objects and dict formats, improving compatibility.

### Fixed
- **Feature Matrix Construction**: Sensitive attributes are now properly excluded from feature matrices before training, preventing data leakage.

- **Sensitive Attribute Encoding**: String sensitive attributes are automatically encoded as integers for PyTorch models, preventing type errors.

- **Result Object Handling**: Validation function now correctly handles both Result objects and dict formats.

### Testing
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive integration test suite (22 new tests):
  - Config schema validation with training section (8 tests)
  - Orchestrator workflow functions (9 tests)
  - MLflow workflow logging (5 tests)
  - CLI end-to-end integration (3 tests)

### Purpose
This major update transforms the toolkit from modular components into a unified, integrated system. Users can now execute a complete fairness workflow from raw data to validated model with a single command, with automatic baseline comparison and threshold validation. This enables CI/CD integration and automated fairness assurance.

**Migration Notes**: 
- Configs without a `training` section continue to work with `fairpipe pipeline` command
- To use integrated workflow, add `training` section to config and use `fairpipe run-pipeline` command
- No breaking changes to existing CLI commands or APIs

---

## [v0.4.2] — 2025-01-XX

### Fixed
- **RealTimeFairnessTracker**: Fixed to use `DatetimeIndex` instead of timestamp column, ensuring proper time-series format as required. Metrics are now stored with timestamp as the index, improving time-series analysis capabilities.

- **FairnessDriftAndAlertEngine**: Enhanced alert severity scoring to incorporate group size (n) from metrics. Smaller groups now reduce confidence in drift detection, preventing false alarms from statistically unreliable samples.

- **FairnessReportingDashboard**: Updated to handle `DatetimeIndex` format with backward compatibility for timestamp column format.

### Changed
- **FairnessReportingDashboard**: Converted intersectional visualization from bar chart to heatmap (`go.Heatmap`) for better visualization of fairness metrics across intersectional subgroups. Heatmap uses diverging colormap (RdYlBu_r) to highlight disparities.

- **FairnessDriftAndAlertEngine**: Severity scoring now considers group size with confidence factors:
  - Groups with n < 30: Reduced confidence (penalized severity)
  - Groups with 30 ≤ n < 100: Gradual confidence increase
  - Groups with n ≥ 100: Full confidence

- **Monitoring Apps**: Updated Streamlit and Dash apps to properly load CSV files with `DatetimeIndex`, maintaining compatibility with new format.

### Added
- **Monitoring Module Demo**: Created `demo_monitoring.ipynb` that simulates a production stream and demonstrates all monitoring components working together:
  - RealTimeFairnessTracker processing batches over time
  - FairnessDriftAndAlertEngine detecting drift and generating alerts
  - FairnessReportingDashboard visualizing trends and intersectional metrics
  - FairnessABTestAnalyzer for A/B testing scenarios

- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test suite for monitoring module:
  - `tests/monitoring/test_tracker.py`: Tests for tracker DatetimeIndex usage, CSV persistence, sliding window, and metric computation
  - Updated `tests/monitoring/test_dashboard_and_drift.py`: Tests for DatetimeIndex handling, heatmap visualization, and severity scoring with group size

### Purpose
This update addresses critical gaps identified in the Monitoring Module assessment, ensuring proper time-series format with DatetimeIndex, complete alert prioritization logic including group size, comprehensive demo notebook demonstrating all components, and improved visualization with heatmap for intersectional analysis.

**Migration Notes**:
- Monitoring apps now expect `DatetimeIndex` format in metrics CSV files
- Old timestamp column format is still supported for backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to API interfaces

---

## [v0.4.1] — 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- **ReductionsWrapper**: Fixed `T` parameter not being passed to `ExponentiatedGradient`. The parameter is now correctly forwarded as `max_iter` to control iteration limits.

### Changed
- **Pareto Visualization**: Enhanced `sweep_pareto()` to automatically save plots when `save_path` is provided, streamlining the workflow for generating and saving Pareto frontier visualizations.

### Added
- **Training Module Demo**: Created `demo_training.ipynb` providing comprehensive examples demonstrating all Training Module components with synthetic data generation, visualizations, and usage patterns.

### Testing
- **Test Coverage**: Expanded test suite with comprehensive edge case testing:
  - ReductionsWrapper: T parameter verification, kwargs override, multiple constraint types
  - Pareto Visualization: save_path functionality, plot generation
  - FairnessRegularizerLoss: single group scenarios, eta edge cases, invalid mode handling
  - GroupFairnessCalibrator: small groups, missing groups, multiple groups, empty inputs

### Purpose
This update addresses critical gaps identified in the Training Module assessment, ensuring all components are properly documented, tested, and functional. The ReductionsWrapper fix ensures proper iteration control, and the expanded test coverage improves reliability.

**Migration Notes**:
- No breaking changes
- ReductionsWrapper now correctly respects `T` parameter for iteration limits

---

## [v0.4.0] — 2025-11-01

### Added
- **Training Module**: Introduced a new module enabling fairness-aware model training, bridging fair data pipelines with fair models. Added components:
  - **ReductionsWrapper (scikit-learn)**: Integrates `fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient` for training under fairness constraints (e.g., Demographic Parity).
  - **FairnessRegularizer (PyTorch)**: Introduces fairness penalties directly into loss functions for differentiable fairness optimization.
  - **LagrangianFairnessTrainer (PyTorch)**: Performs constrained optimization via Lagrange multipliers to enforce Demographic Parity or Equal Opportunity.
  - **GroupFairnessCalibrator**: Post-training correction of prediction probabilities using Platt Scaling or Isotonic Regression.
  - **ParetoFrontier Visualization Tool**: Plots the fairness–accuracy trade-off across varying regularization strengths.

- **CLI Commands**: Added new CLI commands for training:
  - `fairpipe train-regularized`: Train NN with fairness regularizer and generate Pareto frontier
  - `fairpipe train-lagrangian`: Train NN with Lagrangian fairness constraints
  - `fairpipe calibrate`: Apply group-specific calibration to prediction scores

- **Optional Dependencies**: Added `[training]` extra for PyTorch and related dependencies.

### Changed
- **Unified CLI Configuration**: Refined CLI configuration and profile loading (`pipeline.config.yml`) to support both *pipeline* and *training* profiles.

- **Exception Handling**: Refined exception handling for `ExponentiatedGradient` compatibility and PyTorch gradient tracking.

### Testing
- **Test Coverage**: Expanded automated test coverage under `tests/training/` for sklearn, torch, postproc, and visualization submodules.

### Purpose
Phase 6 extends the toolkit's capabilities beyond data-level fairness by embedding fairness constraints directly into model training workflows, ensuring equitable outcomes by design.

**Migration Notes**:
- Training module requires `pip install -e .[training]` to enable PyTorch dependencies
- PyTorch installation may vary by platform (see PyTorch installation guide)
- No breaking changes to existing pipeline or measurement modules

---

## [v0.3.0-rc1] — 2025-10-31

### Added

- **Demo Notebook Generator**: `scripts/make_demo_notebook.py` programmatically creates a clean, runnable `demo.ipynb` showing detection → mitigation → reporting.

- **Artifacts**: Auto-generated `demo.ipynb` ready for Jupyter or VS Code use.

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Expanded README with Phase 5 instructions (E2E tests, demo generation, and MLflow logging).

- **Test Reliability**: Improved test reliability for pipeline and detector integration.

### Purpose
Phase 5 finalized the first release candidate by validating the entire fairness pipeline through automated tests and a reproducible demo.
